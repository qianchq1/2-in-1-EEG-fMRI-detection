# 2-in-1-EEG-fMRI-detection
Reconstruct oscillation signal from 2-in-1 detector into separate EEG and fMRI signals
Download the matlab scripts and put them into the same folder as the data directory. Each data directory has a numerical number.
Run Sup6_Par2.m script in Matlab environment to obtain time-dependent fMRI image series and raw EEG signals. 
Run PlotReconEEG.m in Matlab environment to clean up the baseline, obtaining EEG signals with refined baseline.
